# Digit-Recognizer
This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network for recognizing hand written digits using the MNIST dataset.This model attains a validation accuracy of about 98.4% is obtained after training for 10 epochs.
To train the model run train.csv. The file test.csv generates a file predictDigits.csv which contains the predicted labels to the images in the test set. This file is used for submission at Kaggle.The accuracy of Predictions is 98.31%.
# Dataset
The file train.csv contains pixel intensity values as flattened vectors for 42000 images and their corresponding labels. Similarly, test.csv has pixel intensity values for 28000 unlabelled images.
